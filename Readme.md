# The Knapsack Problem
The knapsack problem is a classic example in computer science, used to illustrate various problem-solving approaches including recursion and dynamic programming.

## Let's start with the recursive solution. \

The idea behind the recursive approach is to consider all subsets of items and calculate the total weight and value of each subset. We only consider subsets whose total weight is within the capacity of the knapsack. For each item, we can either include it in the knapsack or exclude it. This creates a binary tree of possibilities, which we explore recursively.

## Here's a basic outline of the recursive function: 

### Base Case:

If we have no items left or the capacity of the knapsack is 0, the maximum value we can obtain is 0.

### Case 1 - Include the Item: 

If the item's weight is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity, include it and proceed to the next item with reduced capacity.

### Case 2 - Exclude the Item: 

Skip the item and proceed to the next item with the same capacity.

### Return the Maximum Value: 

For each item, we take the maximum of these two cases.
